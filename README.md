# Password-Based Door Lock System

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a secure and user-friendly door lock system. The system utilizes an 8051 microcontroller as its core component and integrates an LCD, keypad, LEDs, and buzzer for interactive user experience and security enhancements.

## Project Goals
**Secure Access Control:** Implement a password-based authentication mechanism to restrict access to authorized individuals.
**User-Friendly Interface:** Provide an intuitive interface using an LCD and keypad for easy password entry and system interaction.
**Enhanced Security Measures:**
Monitor incorrect password attempts.
Trigger an alarm after three consecutive failed attempts to deter unauthorized access.
**Real-time Feedback:** Provide visual and auditory feedback to the user through the LCD, LEDs, and buzzer.

## Project Scope
**Hardware:**
8051 Microcontroller
LCD Display
Keypad
LEDs
Buzzer
Relays (for controlling the door lock mechanism)
**Software:**
8051 Assembly Language
Password storage and verification algorithms
LCD and keypad driver routines
Timer/interrupt routines for controlling unlock duration and monitoring attempts
Alarm triggering logic

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
**Remote Access Control:** Integrate with a smartphone app or other remote control mechanisms for added convenience.
**Fingerprint/RFID Integration:** Enhance security by incorporating fingerprint or RFID readers for biometric authentication.
**Network Connectivity:** Enable remote monitoring and control of the system via a network connection.
